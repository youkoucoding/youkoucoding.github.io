## Golang's installation and configuration with homebrew in Fish shell

### 1. Install golang with homebrew

```fish
brew update
brew search golang
brew info golang # show the information of golang
brew install golang
```

### 2. Setup the workspace:

#### Add environment variables:

First, we'll need to tell Go the location of our workspace.

We'll add some environment variables into shell config.

##### `bash or zsh`

The config files is located at home directory:

`.bash_profile, bashrc, or zshrc`

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/project/go-workspace # don't forget to change the path correctly
export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec
# export GOROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.17/libexec
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
```

> `GOPATH` is the place where we get, build and install packages outside the standard Go tree(AND it's not where the executables are), so it is customizable and thus you can get `GOPATH` wherever you want.

> `GOROOT`, however, is the place where the Go binary distributions (In linux, it's normally in `/usr/local/go`; but for macOs, the Go and the tools are installed in `/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.17/libexec` by default as well as a soft link to `/usr/local/opt/go/libexec` will be created at the same time), so on Linux normally we donâ€™t have to set this variable, but on MacOS, we have to change it as brew installs Go tools to a different path.

##### `fish shell`

Add the code to home directory's `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
set -x GOPATH $HOME/project/go-workspace
set -x GOROOT /usr/local/opt/go/libexec
set -x PATH $PATH:$GOPATH/bin
set -x PATH $PATH:$GOROOT/bin
```

#### Create our own workspace:

`mkdir -p $GOPATH $GOPATH/src $GOPATH/pkg $GOPATH/bin`

- `$GOPATH/src`: where we put the go projects source code

- `$GOPATH/pkg`: contains every package objects

- `$GOPATH/bin`: The compiled binaries's home.
